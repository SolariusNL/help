# About Framework

Framework is an upcoming platform for creating, sharing, and playing games in a safe, civil, and respectful environment. Our goal is to provide a space where people from all backgrounds can come together to connect, play, and create content.

## Key features

### Build your own experiences

Framework offers intuitive and powerful tools for game development, enabling creators of all skill levels to bring their ideas to life. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you can easily design and build games using our platform.

### Share your creations

Share your games with a global audience. Framework provides a seamless process for publishing your creations, making it easy for others to discover and enjoy your work. Maintain full control over your content, licensing, and monetization options - we believe creators should own their creations.

### Cross-platform play

Framework supports cross-platform play, allowing users to enjoy games on various devices without any barriers. Whether you are on a PC, console, or mobile device, you can connect and play with others seamlessly.

### Community-driven

Our community is at the heart of Framework. Solarius remains committed to supporting a diverse and inclusive community where everyone feels welcome and respected. We encourage collaboration, creativity, and positive interactions among our users.
