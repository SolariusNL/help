# I'm experiencing issues with TOTP

TOTP (time-based one-time passwords) is a security feature that requires you to enter a code from your authenticator app when logging in. This code is generated by an authenticator app such as Google Authenticator or Authy.

We implemented TOTP to protect accounts from unauthorized access. Here are some common issues and how to resolve them.

## I lost my TOTP device

If you lost your TOTP device, you can either:

- [Disable TOTP](#disable-totp) on your Framework account using another device.
- [Contact us](/support) to disable TOTP on your account. You will need to provide [proof of ownership](/guides/framework/proof-of-ownership) of the account, which may include a photo of your ID, a selfie, or other form of government-issued identification.

## My codes are suddenly invalid

If your codes are suddenly invalid, it's likely that the time on your device is incorrect. Make sure your device's time is set to automatic.

The reason for this is that TOTP codes are generated based on the current time. If your device's time is incorrect, the codes will be incorrect.

## I'm getting an "Invalid code" error

Make sure you're entering the correct code for the correct account.

## Disable TOTP

Go to your [Security settings](https://framework.solarius.me/settings/security) and uncheck the `TOTP` option within `Verification methods`.

## Contact us

If you need to contact us to disable TOTP on your account, you can do so by [submitting a support ticket](/support). You will need to provide proof of ownership of the account.
