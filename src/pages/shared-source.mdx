# Solarius Shared Source Program

Solarius is proud to introduce the Shared Source Program, an initiative designed to provide controlled access to the source code of select proprietary Solarius projects. 

This program is tailored for individuals and entities engaged in research, development, and education, for the purpose of innovation and collaboration.

## Program Overview

### Source code access

Authorised participants gain privileged access to either entire or partial source code of select Solarius projects. This access is provided under a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license, permitting participants to study, modify, and contribute to the source code.

### Research and development

Educational institutions and students benefit from the program as a valuable resource for learning. Solarius develops several projects of high complexity and innovation, providing a unique opportunity for students to study and contribute to real-world software projects.

### Collaboration

A dedicated platform is provided for program participants to collaborate, share insights, and engage with Solarius engineers. This shift allows us to safeguard intellectual property while enabling collaboration in a more controlled environment.

## Our move away from open source

Solarius has been a staunch supporter of open source principles, as it fosters collaboration and innovation within the wider community. As part of our commitment to transparency, we wish to communicate a strategic shift in our development model. Solarius is transitioning away from its open source model to safeguard our Intellectual Property (IP) while still upholding collaboration with the community.

The decision to move towards a closed source model is driven by a comprehensive evaluation of our business strategy. As we continue to invest in cutting-edge solutions and proprietary technologies, it has become imperative to protect our IP and maintain a competitive edge in the market.

### Intellectual Property

Safeguarding our intellectual property is paramount for ensuring the long-term viability of Solarius. By transitioning to a closed source model, we are better positioned to protect our innovations, trade secrets, and proprietary algorithms. 

This move will allow us to control access to our source code, reducing the risk of unauthorized use or replication.

### Maintaining collaboration

We understand the importance of collaboration and knowledge sharing, and we are committed to maintaining a collaborative environment. The Shared Source Program is designed to provide a controlled environment for collaboration, ensuring that participants can contribute to our projects while respecting our IP.
