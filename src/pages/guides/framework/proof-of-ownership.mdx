# Proof of account ownership

Sometimes, we may ask you to prove that you own an account. This is to prevent unauthorized access to accounts through support manipulation.

## How to prove ownership

We may ask for specific information to prove that you own an account. This information may include:

- Usage of the email address associated with the account.
- Answering specific questions about the account, or about your usage of the account.
- Purchase receipts, invoice or transaction IDs, or other information related to purchases made on the account.
- Government-issued identification documents such as a driver's license or passport.

Depending on the situation, we may ask for other information. Solarius staff will never ask for your password.
