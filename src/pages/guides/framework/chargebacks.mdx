  "What happens when I initiate a chargeback on a Framework purchase?";

# Chargebacks

A chargeback refers to a dispute initiated by a user through their payment provider (e.g., credit card company or bank) to request a refund for a transaction made on Framework. Chargebacks are typically initiated when a user believes that a transaction was fraudulent or unauthorized.

## Prohibited use

It is important to note that initiating chargebacks on Framework (and any other Solarius service) is strictly prohibited. Users are explicitly prohibited from pursuing chargebacks for any transaction made on the platform. If a user initiates a chargeback, it will result in an immediate and permanent suspension of their account.

<Note>
Chargebacks are a costly and time-consuming process for both Solarius and the user. In addition, chargebacks can have a negative impact on Framework's reputation and merchant account. As such, we have a zero-tolerance policy for chargebacks.

If a user is not satisfied with a transaction, they should contact our support team to request a refund instead of initiating a chargeback.

</Note>

## Refund policy

While chargebacks are not permitted, we understand that there may be instances where users require refunds for valid reasons. For such cases, we have a dedicated refund policy and process in place to ensure a fair resolution.

### Valid reasons for refunds

- **Accidental or Duplicate Purchases**: If a user accidentally makes multiple purchases of the same item or if a purchase was made unintentionally, they can request a refund.
- **Faulty Content**: In the event that the content received by the user is defective, damaged, or not as described, they have the right to request a refund.
- **Billing Errors**: If a user identifies an error in the billing information associated with their transaction, they can request a refund.

## Requesting a refund

To initiate a refund request, users must follow the following steps:

- Contact us through our [support channels](/support).
- File a support ticket providing detailed information about the refund request, including the reason for the refund and any supporting evidence if applicable.
- Our support team will review the request and respond within a reasonable timeframe to provide further assistance and guide users through the refund process.

Please note that refund requests will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and decisions will be made in accordance with our refund policy.
