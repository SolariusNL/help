## I lost my email

  <Col>

    Uh oh! If you have lost access to your email, you will need to contact us at <a href="mailto:recover@solarius.me">recover@solarius.me</a> or [see support methods](/support) to recover your account. Please include the following information in your email:

    <Properties>
      <Property name="Your username">
        This is the username you use to log in to Solarius.
      </Property>
      <Property name="Original email address">
        This is the email address you used to sign up for Solarius, the one you no longer have access to.
      </Property>
    </Properties>

    We may ask you for additional information to verify your identity, such as a:

    - Photo of your ID
    - Photo of you holding your ID
    - Proof of address

    Unfortunately, it is hard to verify that you are the owner of an account without access to the original email address. We will do our best to verify your identity and recover your account.
