## Acceptable use

Infra provides cloud hosting, storage, and related features. Customers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their use of Infra. Prohibited content includes unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, or otherwise objectionable material. Customers are responsible for maintaining the security of their accounts and must immediately report any unauthorized use.

Customers are not permitted to host or store any content that infringes on the intellectual property rights of others, is illegal, or violates the rights of any third party. We reserve the right to remove any content that violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable.

## Registration

Account registration requires accurate and complete information. Customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account credentials.

## Fees and payment

Fees for using Infra are based on the selected pricing plan and specified billing cycles. Customers are responsible for any applicable taxes. Payment is due in advance of the billing cycle. Failure to pay may result in account suspension or termination.

## Intellectual property

Solarius retains all rights, title, and interest in the Platform, including all intellectual property rights. Customers retain ownership of their content and grant Solarius a license to host and store such content.

Except as expressly permitted by these Terms, customers may not reproduce, modify, or distribute any part of the Platform without prior written consent.

## Termination

Customers may cancel their account at any time, and we reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts for violations of these Terms or for any other reason at our discretion. Upon termination, customers will lose access to their account and any stored content.

Solarius will provide archival access to customer content for a limited period following termination. Customers are responsible for retrieving their content before the archival period expires.

## Limitation of liability

Solarius is **not** liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from the use of the Platform. Customers use the Platform at their own risk.

For any breach of these Terms, Solarius's liability is limited to the amount paid by the customer in the three months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

## Indemnification

Customers agree to indemnify and hold Solarius harmless from any claims, damages, or losses arising from their use of the Platform, including any violation of these Terms.

## Changes

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

By continuing to access or use the Platform after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Platform.

## Governing law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Netherlands, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding the Platform and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Platform.
