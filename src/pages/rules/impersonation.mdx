# Impersonation

At Solarius, we prioritize trust and transparency within our community. Impersonation, the act of pretending to be someone else, undermines these principles and is strictly prohibited. This policy outlines our stance on impersonation and the consequences for those found in violation.

## What is impersonation?

Impersonation involves pretending to be another individual or entity, typically to deceive or mislead others. This includes, but is not limited to:

- **Impersonating Solarius staff:** Pretending to be an official representative of Framework, including staff members, administrators, or support personnel.
- **User impersonation:** Falsely presenting oneself as another Framework user with the intent to deceive or cause harm.

## Consequences of impersonation

Solarius takes impersonation on the Framework platform seriously, and violations of this policy will result in severe consequences. These may include:

- **Account suspension:** Temporary suspension of the impersonating account.
- **Permanent ban:** In cases of repeated or egregious impersonation, the account may be permanently banned.
- **Legal action:** In certain circumstances, impersonation may lead to legal action if it involves fraudulent activities or causes significant harm.

## Reporting impersonation

If you encounter any instances of impersonation on the Framework platform, please report them immediately. You can do so through our official channels, including our support system or community reporting features.
