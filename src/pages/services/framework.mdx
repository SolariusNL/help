## About the platform

Roblox is a game platform that allows users to create and play games. It is a great platform, but it has some significant issues:

- It is centralised, meaning that Roblox has full control over the platform and can do whatever they want with it.
- It is closed-source, meaning that nobody can see how the platform works nor can anybody contribute to it.
- Roblox is not privacy-focused. It collects a lot of data about its users and sells it to advertisers.
- Roblox income is not distributed fairly. Roblox takes a 30% cut of all game sales, and developers have no way to monetise their games without Roblox.

Framework - a decentralised alternative to Framework. See the comparison below:

## Why should I use Framework?

Framework is a great platform for many reasons:
