## About the platform

We aspire to create a safe, free, and private community where people can come together to build games and enjoy playing them. Our platform is built on the principles of privacy, freedom, and nostalgia. We envision a space where users can unleash their creativity and build games that are truly their own.

## Development

Framework is under active development. We are working hard to make the platform delightful to use and to ensure that it is a safe and secure space for everyone.

As of now, Framework development is not open to the public. We are working on building a solid foundation for the platform and will open up development to the public once we are ready.
