# Udmux

Udmux is an advanced DDoS mitigation service that protects your website from DDoS attacks - comparable to Cloudflare.

<Note>
  Udmux is currently only available to Solarius services while we work on
  building a public version.
</Note>

## How it works

Udmux works by routing all traffic through our servers, which then filter out malicious traffic and only allow legitimate traffic to reach your website.

We identify 'legitimate' traffic by using a combination of machine learning and heuristics to determine whether a request is legitimate or not.

## What it protects against

- Layer 3/4 attacks
- Layer 7 attacks
- HTTP floods
- UDP floods
- SYN floods
- DNS amplification attacks
- NTP amplification attacks
- SSDP amplification attacks
- Memcached amplification attacks
- Slowloris attacks
- RUDY attacks
- HTTP GET/POST floods
- HTTP slow read attacks
- HTTP slow POST attacks
- and more...

## How we protect against it

Our global infrastructure has a network capacity of over 750Tbps, which allows us to absorb even the largest of DDoS attacks.

Cloudflare, for comparison, has a network capacity of ~209Tbps. This means that we can absorb 3.5x the amount of traffic that Cloudflare can.

## Cost of Udmux

Udmux will have a flat rate of $5/mo per domain, with no bandwidth limits or other restrictions. This is a fraction of the cost of Cloudflare, which charges $20/mo for the same service.

<Note>
  We may charge additional fees for domains that receive a large amount of
  traffic, but this will be on a case-by-case basis.
