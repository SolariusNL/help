# I expected to receive a 1099-K tax form for 2023 but didn't, why not?

The recently announced IRS delay in lowering the 1099-K reporting threshold may mean that you're no longer eligible to receive a 1099-K tax form for the 2023 tax year.

<Note>
  Please note: This change does not apply to 1099-NEC and 1099-MISC thresholds,
  which remain at $600 USD. If you're not sure which form type you will receive,
  please reach out to your platform.

On November 21, 2023, the IRS made an [announcement](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-delay-in-form-1099-k-reporting-threshold-for-third-party-platform-payments-in-2023-plans-for-a-threshold-of-5000-for-2024-to-phase-in-implementation) regarding a postponement in the reduction of the 1099-K reporting threshold. Consequently, for the tax year 2023, the 1099-K filing threshold will remain unchanged from the previous tax year. Platforms will only be obligated to file 1099-K forms for accounts that have processed a total gross volume exceeding 20,000 USD and 200 transactions.

If you have successfully submitted a Form W-8, validating your Non-US tax status, this would exempt you from receiving a 1099-K form.

Several platforms proactively collaborated with Solarius Pay as early as October to reach out to individuals and businesses that had surpassed the initially announced $600 USD threshold. If you received an email from Solarius Express prompting you to take action to obtain your 2023 1099-K tax form but have not yet received the form itself, it is possible that you were affected by this delayed threshold adjustment. To ascertain whether you meet the federal and/or state threshold eligibility requirements, kindly check with your platform.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
