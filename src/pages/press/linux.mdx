# Linux

At Solarius, we've made a thoughtful choice to go all-in on Linux. It's not just the operating system for our workstations and servers; it's the heartbeat of our software development and a key player in delivering a top-notch user experience.

## Appeal of Linux

Why did we opt for Linux? In simple terms, it stands out as the best in the tech world. More than just facilitating seamless software development and providing a robust server foundation, Linux excels in versatility. Beyond technical specifications, our choice is rooted in the desire to offer users an exceptional experience.

From its inception, Linux has thrived as a community-driven project. Free from single-company ownership or a singular agenda, it embodies a collaborative effort by thousands of developers and companies worldwide. This dynamic nature ensures continuous evolution and improvement, exemplifying the power of open-source software.

Recent years have witnessed a surge in Linux's popularity, marked by key developments:

- Steam's adoption of Linux for the Steam Deck
- Microsoft's incorporation of WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) into Windows
- Over 50% of developers using Linux as their primary OS
- Linux reigning as the most popular OS for cloud computing
- Enhanced user-friendliness in distributions like Ubuntu and Fedora
- Linux powering 100% of the top 500 supercomputers
- Consistent contributions from tech giants to the Linux kernel

## The significance of Linux in our workflow

Linux is the foundation of our software development lifecycle, from code creation to testing and deployment. It forms the backbone of our servers, driving our website, API, and cloud services.

As advocates for open-source principles, our code mirrors the transparency and collaborative spirit of Linux. We believe that open-source innovation propels the industry forward, and we take pride in contributing to this movement.

## Compatibility beyond Linux

While Linux is our preference, rest assured that our software is designed for universal compatibility. Rigorously tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux, it also comes in a web version accessible on any device with a web browser. Our hope is that, even if you don't currently use Linux, our dedication to excellence will resonate with you.
