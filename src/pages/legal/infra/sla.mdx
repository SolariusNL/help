# Infra Service Level Agreement

This Service Level Agreement (SLA) outlines the service commitments provided by Infra for our cloud hosting services. It describes the level of service our customers can expect and the support provided for any issues that may arise.

## Service availability

Infra strives to maintain a high level of service availability for our cloud hosting platform. We guarantee that our services will be available at least 99.9% of the time during any given calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance and force majeure events.

## Service level targets

### Uptime

We measure service availability as the percentage of time our services are accessible to customers during a calendar month. The uptime percentage is calculated as follows:

```
Uptime Percentage = (Total Time - Downtime) / Total Time * 100
```

Where:

- "Total Time" is the total number of minutes in a calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance.
- "Downtime" is the total number of minutes our services are unavailable to customers during a calendar month.

### Scheduled maintenance

We may occasionally perform scheduled maintenance to ensure the reliability and security of our cloud hosting platform. We will provide advance notice of any planned maintenance via email or on our website. Scheduled maintenance is not considered downtime for the purpose of calculating the uptime percentage.

### Force majeure events

Force majeure events, including but not limited to natural disasters, acts of terrorism, or internet disruptions, may affect our ability to provide services. We will not be held liable for any downtime caused by force majeure events.

## Support

We are committed to providing timely and efficient support to our customers. Our support team will respond to inquiries and issues based on the following priority levels:

### Critical

Issues designated as "Critical" impact the availability and functionality of the services severely. Our support team will respond to critical priority issues within 1 hour after receiving the support request.

### High

Issues designated as "High" impact the availability or functionality of the services significantly. Our support team will respond to high priority issues within 4 hours after receiving the support request.

### Medium

Issues designated as "Medium" impact the services but do not severely affect availability or functionality. Our support team will respond to medium priority issues within 12 hours after receiving the support request.

### Low

Issues designated as "Low" are non-critical inquiries or requests for information. Our support team will respond to low priority issues within 24 hours after receiving the support request.

## Customer responsibilities

Customers are responsible for maintaining the security of their accounts and infrastructure hosted on our platform. You agree to comply with our Acceptable Use Policy and to promptly report any suspected security breaches or unauthorized access to our support team.

## Limitations of liability

In no event shall Solarius or its affiliates be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from service interruptions or unavailability.

## Changes to the SLA

We may update this Service Level Agreement from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes, and the updated SLA will be effective as of the date specified in the updated agreement.

By using Infra's cloud hosting services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to this Service Level Agreement.
