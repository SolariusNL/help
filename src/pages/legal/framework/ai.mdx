# AI Content Guidelines and Compliance

With the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence tools, notably [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), there has been a surge in the creation of content that seamlessly mimics human-generated output. This surge presents new challenges for content creators and regulatory bodies alike. This document outlines the provisions that creators utilising AI tools on Framework must adhere to, with the aim of safeguarding the integrity of the platform and ensuring compliance with legal standards.

## Prohibited content categories

The following categories of content are prohibited on Framework. Creators are expected to adhere to these guidelines to ensure that their content is compliant with the law and ethical norms.

### 1. AI-generated music

AI-generated music is expressly prohibited on Framework due to the inherent risk of copyright infringement.

The capability of AI to produce original musical compositions raises concerns, and as such, the creation of AI-generated music is not allowed.

### 2. Defamatory, threatening, or illegal Content

AI-generated content that falls under the categories of defamation, threats, or any other form of illegal expression is strictly prohibited on Framework. The platform places a high premium on content that upholds legal standards and ethical norms.

### 3. Misleading or deceptive AI-generated content

Content created with AI tools with the intention to mislead or deceive users is not allowed on Framework. This includes but is not limited to deepfakes of public figures, which have the potential to cause harm and undermine trust within the community.

### 4. AI-generated responses on developer forum

The Framework Developer Forum maintains a policy that prohibits the use of AI-generated responses.

All responses posted on the forum must be authored by humans to uphold the quality and authenticity of the content shared within the community.

## Labeling requirements

All AI-generated content must be clearly labeled as such. This labeling should be evident, for example, by incorporating the text "AI-generated" in the title of the content. This transparency is essential for users to distinguish between human-generated and AI-generated content, promoting informed engagement.

## Arbitration

The Framework team reserves the right to remove any content that violates the guidelines outlined in this document. In the event of a dispute, the Framework team will act as the final arbiter of the content in question.

## Automated detection

Solarius actively maintains several systems to flag AI-generated content for human review. These systems are constantly being improved to ensure that the platform remains free of prohibited content.
