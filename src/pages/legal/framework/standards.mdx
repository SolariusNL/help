# Framework Community Standards

Framework is a platform where people from different backgrounds come together to connect, play, and create
content. Our community standards outline our expectations for how our community should behave, both on and
off the platform. We strive to create a safe, respectful, fair, and transparent environment for everyone
who uses our platform.

## Safety

We take safety seriously. We want all of our users to feel safe and secure while using our platform. To
ensure the safety of our community, we have the following guidelines:

- **Personal information**: Do not share personal information, such as your full name, address, or phone
  number, on the platform.
- **Bullying and harassment**: Do not engage in any form of bullying or harassment on the platform. This
  includes name-calling, threats, or any other behavior that makes someone feel uncomfortable or unsafe.
- **Scams and fraud**: Do not engage in any scams or fraud on the platform. This includes phishing
  attempts, pyramid schemes, or any other fraudulent behavior.
- **Violence and threat**: Do not make any threats or engage in any violent behavior on the platform.
- **Sexual content**: Do not share any sexual content or engage in any sexual behavior on the platform.
  This includes nudity, sexual language, or any other sexually explicit content.

## Respect

Respect for others and their opinions are one of our highest priorities. We believe that everyone should
be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion,
or any other characteristic. To maintain a respectful environment within our community, we have the
following guidelines:

- **Hate speech**: Do not engage in any hate speech on the platform. This includes language or behavior
  that promotes discrimination or prejudice against a particular group of people.
- **Discrimination**: Do not engage in any discriminatory behavior on the platform. This includes any
  behavior that excludes or treats someone unfairly based on their race, gender, sexual orientation,
  religion, or any other characteristic.
- **Trolling**: Do not engage in any trolling behavior on the platform. This includes posting offensive
  or controversial content with the intention of provoking others.
- **Offensive content**: Do not post any content that is offensive or inappropriate. This includes content
  that is violent, vulgar, or sexually explicit.

## Free Speech

At Framework, we honor free speech, but with some limitations. It is a fact that free speech is never
absolute. We believe that free speech is a fundamental right, but it is not a right that can be exercised
of the expense of others. We want our community to be a place where people can express themselves freely,
fairly. To ensure free speech within our community, we have the following guidelines:

- **Hate speech**: Do not engage in any hate speech on the platform. This includes language or behavior
  that promotes discrimination or prejudice against a particular group of people.
- **Incitement** to violence: Do not incite violence or encourage others to engage in violent behavior on
  the platform.
- **Defamation**: Do not engage in any defamation on the platform. This includes making false or harmful
  statements about someone.
- **Harassment**: Do not engage in any harassment on the platform. This includes name-calling, threats,
  or any other behavior that makes someone feel uncomfortable or unsafe.

## Fairness and Transparency

We believe in fairness and transparency. We want our community to be a place where everyone is treated
equally and has a voice. To protect the democratic nature of our community, we have the following
guidelines:

- **Rules and policies**: Follow our rules and policies. We have guidelines in place to ensure that our
  community remains safe, respectful, and fair.
- **Reporting**: Report any violations of our community standards to us. We take reports seriously and
  will investigate any violations to our upmost ability to maintain fairness within our community.
- **Appeals process**: If you feel that your account has been unfairly suspended or terminated, you can
  appeal the decision through our appeals process. We will review your appeal and take appropriate action
  based on the circumstances.
- **Transparency**: We are committed to being transparent with our community. We will communicate any
  changes to our policies or guidelines and provide explanations for any actions we take.
- **Votes**: For major decisions that can impact the path of the platform, we will hold a vote to ensure
  that the community has a say in the matter to determine what is best for the platform and it's users.

## Moderation

To ensure that our community standards are upheld, we have a team of moderators who monitor the platform
for violations. Our moderators have the authority to take action against users who violate our community
standards, including warning, suspending, or terminating accounts.

We also rely on our community to report any violations of our standards. If you see something that you
believe violates our standards, please report it to us.

Additionally, because Framework is a decentralized & [federated](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Federation_(information_technology)>) platform,
administrative actions and bans are exchanged between instances in the 'main' [fediverse](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fediverse). This is incredibly
effective at preventing users from circumventing bans by simply creating a new account on another instance,
and is also effective because it does not require a huge team of moderators to manage.

At Framework, we are committed to creating a safe, respectful, fair, and transparent community for
everyone who uses our platform. Our community standards are in place to ensure that everyone is able to
enjoy the platform without fear of harassment or discrimination. We expect all of our users to adhere to
these standards, and we will take action against those who violate them. Thank you for being a part of
our community. We hope you enjoy your time on Framework!
