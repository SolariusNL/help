# Framework Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes how Framework ("framework.solarius.me", "we", "us", "Solarius") collects,
protects and uses the personally identifiable information you may provide through the
framework.solarius.me website or its API. The policy also describes the choices available to you
regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This policy
does not apply to the practices of companies that Solarius does not own or control, or to
individuals that Solarius does not employ or manage.

## What info do we collect?

- **Basic account info:** If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a
  password. You may also enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography,
  and upload a profile picture and header image. The username, display name, biography, profile
  picture and header image are always listed publicly.
- **Following, profile metadata, and other public information:** The list of accounts you follow is public, and
  the same is true for your followers. Your profile metadata (display name, biography, profile picture,
  profile links, badges, alias, etc.) is also public. Your profile metadata may be displayed in search
  results and on other users' lists of followers. Your profile metadata may also be displayed in the
  API, other third-party applications, and other Framework instances in the fediverse.
- **Games:** Your game data is stored on and served from this Framework instance. This includes your
  actual game file, datastores, gamepasses, and other game-related data. Games are always public,
  and anyone can view and play them.
- **IP addresses and other information:** When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from,
  as well as the name of your browser application. All the logged in sessions are available for your
  review and revocation in the settings. The latest IP address used is stored for up to 12 months.
  We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.
- **Hardware identifiers:** When using the Framework client, we may collect a hardware identifier
  unique to your device. This identifier is used for strictly moderation purposes, and is not used
  for any other purpose. This identifier is not used for tracking, and is not shared with any third
  parties.
- **E-mail address:** We collect your e-mail address when you create an account. Your e-mail may be
  used to reset your password if you forget it, and to send you account-related notifications.
  Your e-mail address is not publicly displayed, and we do not share it with any third parties.
- **Direct messages:** We store your direct messages, including the messages themselves, the time
  they were sent, and the accounts involved in the conversations. Direct messages are private and
  are not publicly visible on the service. We do not share direct messages with any third parties,
  and they are only accessible to the sender, receiver(s) and Solarius employees, contractors and
  agents, as necessary to perform maintenance on the direct message system or investigate reports
  of abuse.

## What do we use your information for?

Any of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:

- To provide the core functionality of Framework. You can only interact with other people's content
  and post your own content when you are logged in.
- To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to
  determine ban evasion or other violations.
- The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people
  interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other
  requests or questions.

## How do we protect your info?

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information
when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session,
as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password
is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. You may enable two-factor authentication to further secure
access to your account.

## Data retention policy

We will make a good faith effort to:

- Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server, in so far as such logs
  are kept, no more than 90 days.
- Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users no more than 12 months.

You may irreversibly delete your account at any time.

## Do we use cookies?

Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard
drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems
to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. We use cookies to help us
remember your login session and various appearance settings.

We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.

## Do we disclose any information to outside parties?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable
information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website,
conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information
confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply
with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.

Your public content may be downloaded by other servers in the fediverse, and may be displayed on
other Framework instances. Our specifically-designed federation protocol ensures that your content
remains private to the extent that you have chosen.

## Site usage by children

This site is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian believes that
framework.solarius.me has in its database the personally-identifiable information of a child under
the age of 13, please contact us immediately (using the contact information below) and we will use
our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.

## Changes to this privacy policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you about significant changes
in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified
in your account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
